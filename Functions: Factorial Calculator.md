## Functions: Factorial Calculator in C (Using Function)
## Aim
To write a C program that calculates the factorial of a given number using a user-defined function.

## Algorithm
Start the program.

Declare the function fact().

In the main() function, call the fact() function.

In the fact() function:

a. Declare variables i, N, and fact (initialized to 1).

b. Read an integer N from the user.

c. Use a for loop from 1 to N:

Multiply fact by i in each iteration.

d. After the loop, print the factorial value.

End the program.

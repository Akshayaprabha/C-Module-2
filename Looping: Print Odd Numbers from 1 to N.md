## Looping: Print Odd Numbers from 1 to N in C
## Aim
To write a C program that prints all odd numbers from 1 to n, where n is an integer input by the user.

## Algorithm
Declare variables n and i.

Read the value of n from the user.

Iterate i from 1 to n using a for loop.

Inside the loop:

If i is odd, print its value.

Increment i to skip the next even number (can also increment by 2 for simplicity).

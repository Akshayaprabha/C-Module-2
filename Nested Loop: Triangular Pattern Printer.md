## Nested Loop:Triangular Pattern Printer in C
## Aim
To write a C program that prints a triangular pattern of $ symbols using nested loops based on a user-defined value n.

## Algorithm
Declare variables n, i, and j.

Read the value of n from the user.

Use a for loop to iterate i from n to 1.

Inside the outer loop, use another for loop to iterate j from 1 to i and print "$".

After each inner loop, print a newline character (\n) to move to the next line.

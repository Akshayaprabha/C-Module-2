Nested Loop: Number and Symbol Pattern Printer in C
## Aim
To write a C program that prints the following specific pattern using nested loops:

1@@@@1  
12@@@21  
123@@321  
1234@4321  
1234554321  
## Algorithm
Initialize variables i and j.

Use nested loops to iterate over rows and columns.

In each row:

Print numbers in ascending order from 1 to i.

Print @ symbols for (n - i) positions, where n is the total number of rows.

Print numbers in descending order from i to 1.
